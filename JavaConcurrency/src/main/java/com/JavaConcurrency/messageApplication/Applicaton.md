Developing a messaging application that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The application has the following requirements:

1. Users can send messages to each other.
2. Each user can receive messages from other users.
3. The application should support concurrent access by multiple users sending and receiving messages simultaneously.
4. Ensure that messages are delivered in the order they were sent.
5. Implement logging to track all message transactions.

Write a Java program to implement the above requirements. Use Java threads and concurrency mechanisms to ensure thread safety and proper synchronization.

Feel free to expand or modify the requirements based on your preferences and the complexity you want to achieve in your solution.
